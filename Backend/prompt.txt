Universal 5-Stage Asset Progression Template

Use by saying: “Make the assets for {THING}”.
This will generate all 5 prompts below, tailored to the nature of {THING}.

IMAGE 1 — Initialization (Base, Lowest State)

```md
Square image (1:1)

flat 2D digital illustration
storybook fantasy style
soft painterly brush texture
muted, cold, or neutral palette appropriate for the {THING}
no photorealism
no outlines

Depict the {THING} in its lowest, weakest, most desolate, inactive, or deteriorated form — whatever makes sense for the nature of the {THING}.

If the {THING} can be damaged or decayed:
emphasize lifelessness, harshness, stillness.

If the {THING} is natural (sky, plant, water, terrain):
use bleak, cold atmospheres, heavy clouds, fog, or dryness.

If the {THING} is an object, structure, or creature:
use dull colors, weak lighting, cracks, tiredness, or reduced form.

This is the baseline reference image for all later stages.
```

IMAGE 2 — Early Shift (Subtle Improvement)

```md
Use the previous image as reference.

Preserve the same art style, composition, proportions, and camera angle.
Do not change framing or layout.

The {THING} begins showing small improvements appropriate to its nature:
• slightly better lighting
• softened harsh features
• gentle hints of color or life
• reduced damage or tension
• faint warmth or clarity

Mood is still subdued, but no longer fully desolate.
```

IMAGE 3 — Stabilization / Growth / Renewal

```md
Use the previous image as reference.

Preserve the same art style, composition, proportions, and camera angle.

The {THING} becomes clearly healthier, calmer, or more functional:
• colors become richer but still soft
• shapes or textures smooth out
• lighting becomes warm and balanced
• signs of growth, repair, or harmony appear

Atmosphere feels peaceful, stable, and gently uplifting.
```

IMAGE 4 — Near-Final Positive State

```md
Use the previous image as reference.

Preserve the same art style, composition, proportions, and camera angle.

The {THING} is now bright, strong, healthy, or joyful.
Enhance the elements introduced in Stage 3:
• lively but still painterly color
• warm natural lighting
• harmonious shapes and textures

This is the near-final stage:
the {THING} should look almost fully alive or fully restored, just missing its final spark.
```

IMAGE 5 — Final State (Peak Vitality + One Elegant Spark)

```md
Use the previous image as reference.

Preserve the same art style, composition, proportions, and camera angle.
Do not change framing or layout.

The {THING} reaches its absolute peak state:
• richest natural colors
• brightest warm lighting
• fully alive, functional, joyful, or powerful
• completely consistent with Stage 4’s style and mood

Introduce exactly one elegant spark element, appropriate to the {THING}:
• a pastel rainbow in the distance (sky/landscape)
• a small bird or butterfly (nature scenes)
• a glowing fruit or cluster of flowers (plants)
• a soft sunbeam or halo highlight (any outdoor scene)
• a gentle magical glint or shimmer (crystals, artifacts)
• a single bright specular point (objects)

The spark must be subtle, painterly, integrated, and feel like a natural culmination of Stage 4 — not a style change.

This marks the final, most alive and expressive version of the {THING}.
